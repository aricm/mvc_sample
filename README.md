# Sample of code written using the MVC architecture from a recent project

This from a reservation booking app built for an adventure resort (lodging and river rafting trips). This particular sample code is from the guide scheduling section. This section allowed managers to assign staff (guides) to a booked trip based on their qualifications and availability. 

The app was built on top of CodeIgniter PHP framework with Bootstrap for the views and AngularJS for most AJAX calls and binding between views
